Pandas
Pandas is a powerful open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures like Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional) that allow for easy handling and processing of structured data. Pandas makes it simple to clean, transform, and visualize data, making it an essential tool for data analysis and machine learning.

NumPy
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a library used for numerical computations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. NumPy is known for its performance and efficiency, making it a core library for scientific computing and an underlying component for many other libraries like Pandas and TensorFlow.

TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. It uses data flow graphs to model mathematical computations, making it highly efficient for deep learning and neural network training. TensorFlow supports both CPU and GPU computations, allowing for flexible and scalable machine learning model development.

Keras
Keras is an open-source, high-level neural networks API written in Python that runs on top of other machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and Theano. It provides an easy-to-use interface for building and training deep learning models with a minimal amount of code. Keras is designed to enable fast experimentation and prototyping, making it a popular choice for beginners and researchers.

Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
Scikit-Learn is a simple and efficient open-source library for machine learning in Python. It provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms through a consistent interface. Scikit-Learn is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, making it a powerful tool for data analysis, model training, and evaluation in machine learning projects.

PyTorch
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a dynamic computational graph, which allows for more flexibility and ease when building neural network models. PyTorch is popular among researchers for its simplicity, ease of use, and dynamic nature, making it suitable for deep learning and AI research.
